We use bower and npm for package management.

## Install npm/bower-toolchain

This has to be executed only once. The following instructions are for Linux and MacOS users:

1) [install nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) (manage multiple versions of NodeJS/npm for package management)
```
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.25.4/install.sh | bash
```

2) open a new shell and execute:

```
nvm install iojs
nvm use iojs
npm install -g bower
```

## Development

1) Clean up and install dependencies
```
npm prune && npm install
bower prune && bower install
```

2) Start HTTP server
```
npm start
```

3) Open http://localhost:8080/index.html
