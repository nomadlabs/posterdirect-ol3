We want bower and npm for package management.

Following instructions are for Linux and MacOS users:

1) [install nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) (manage multiple versions of NodeJS/npm for package management)
```
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.25.4/install.sh | bash
```

2) open a new shell and execute:

```
nvm install iojs
nvm use iojs
npm install -g bower
```

3) 
```
npm install
bower install
```
